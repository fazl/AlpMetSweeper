# AlpMetSweeper
This is a Java Swing implementation of the classic Mine Sweeper game.
It was a project submission in the Fall 2018 CS201 second year Java/OOP 1-semester course submitted by Alper and Metehan.

I'm putting it on GitHub in the hope that they or some other students might be interested in picking it up and adding ideas.
(Original version is still available - simply checkout the first revision.)

I used to be addicted to minesweeper so I have had a lot of fun refactoring and adapting it.

I've mostly tried to make my changes discrete so you can diff each pair of revisions and figure out each logical change.

Also you can simply fork this repo if you want to adapt the game to your own ideas.  If you then check it out as a new project in Intellij v 2018 or 2017 it should build and run out of the box (but you may need to setup the SDK if you have a different Java installation than I have used).

Once you've played with it, think up some changes.  Examples of ideas I could suggest:

###Extra controls in the menu
For things like:
- grid size 
- number of mines
- dynamic cell size to allow grids > 20x20

###Display area in the game 
For things like:
- timer 
- click count
- mines not found yet

### Porting the game 
As a way to learn something new e.g.
- Using Java/FX instead of Swing
- A different **language** (python, go, javascript/html5)
- A **mobile platform** e.g. Android, ios 

Let your imagination take flight, and send some feedback.
