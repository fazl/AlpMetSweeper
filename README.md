# AlpMetSweeper
This was a project submission in a CS201 second year Java/OOP 1-semester course submitted by Alper Kocabiyik and Metehan Talay.
I'm putting it up on github in the hope that they or some other students might be interested in picking it up and taking it further.

It's a nice implementation of the classic mine sweeper type game.
I used to be addicted to minesweeper!
